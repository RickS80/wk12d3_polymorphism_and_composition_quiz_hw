WHAT DOES THE WORD 'POLYMORPHISM' MEAN?

Polymorphism comes from the ancient Greek words 'poly' and 'morphe' meaning many forms.


WHAT DOES IT MEAN WHEN WE APPLY POLYMORPHISM TO OO DESIGN? GIVE A SIMPLE JAVA EXAMPLE.

Polymorphism means that we can put several objects into an enclosing type that defines a contract between them all. This can be done in Java by using
abstract classes and/or inheritances.

An abstract class act as a super-class which sub-classes can inherit from.

Interfaces allows us to treat a class as having another 'type'. One benefit of interfaces is that a class can implement multiple interfaces vs abstract
class where each class can only ever have one abstract superclass.


WHAT CAN WE USE TO IMPLEMENT POLYMORPHISM IN JAVA?

We can use abstract classes and interfaces.


HOW MANY 'FORMS' CAN AN OBJECT TAKE WHEN USING POLYMORPHISM?

Abstract classes - one abstract class can have multiple subclasses. However a subclass can only extend one superclass.

Interfaces - classes can implement multiple interfaces.


GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF WHEN YOU COULD USE POLYMORPHISM.

Polymorphism allows code to be both dry and scaleable which is best practice for large codebases.

COMPOSITION
WHAT DO WE MEAN BY 'COMPOSITION' IN REFERENCE TO OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING?




WHEN WOULD YOU USE COMPOSITION? PROVIDE A SIMPLE EXAMPLE IN JAVA.

WHAT IS/ARE THE ADVANTAGE(S) OF USING COMPOSITION?

WHAT HAPPENS TO THE BEHAVIOURS WHEN THE OBJECT COMPOSED OF THEM IS DESTROYED?
